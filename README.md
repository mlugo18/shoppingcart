# Shopping Cart

## Description: 
This repository contains a simple shopping cart React application using Strapi for the database management.

## How to Run:
Clone the full repository to reside in a single registry. Verify the references to the images to validate the image links have not been broken. You will need to setup your own Strapi localhost admin and add the product list and fields as needed by the js app. Make sure to run the React application on a local server in addition to the Strapi host.
